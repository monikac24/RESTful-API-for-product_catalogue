# Project Overview: RESTful API for Product Catalogue
# Project Name:
# RESTful API for Product Catalogue

Client/Organization:
ABC Company

Objective
The goal of this project was to develop a robust, efficient, and scalable RESTful API for managing a product catalogue. This API facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, enabling seamless integration with a variety of client applications like e-commerce websites, mobile apps, and internal systems.

The API's purpose is to allow users and administrators to:

Add, update, and remove products.
Retrieve product details, including availability, ratings, and categories.
Search and filter products based on attributes.
Technologies Used
The project employed the following technologies:

Backend Framework:

Spring Boot: To build and manage the RESTful API services.
Spring Data MongoDB: To integrate MongoDB as the database.
Database:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store unstructured and semi-structured data, ideal for flexible product attributes.
Language:

Java: The primary language for API development.
Tools and Environment:

Postman for API testing.
IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse as the development environment.
Git for version control.
Deployment Platform:

Docker (Optional): For containerization and easy deployment.
AWS/Heroku for hosting.
Key Activities
Requirement Gathering:

Collaborated with ABC stakeholders to understand business needs.
Identified key product fields like name, description, price, categories, attributes, availability, and ratings.
Database Schema Design:

Designed a MongoDB schema to store product data flexibly with nested objects like ratings and availability.
API Development:

Designed RESTful endpoints for operations like:
POST /api/products: To add a new product.
GET /api/products: To fetch all products or filter based on attributes.
GET /api/products/{id}: To retrieve a specific product by ID.
PUT /api/products/{id}: To update a product.
DELETE /api/products/{id}: To delete a product.
Error Handling:

Implemented structured error responses for invalid inputs (e.g., 400, 404, 500 statuses).
Testing:

Conducted functional testing using Postman.
Wrote unit tests with JUnit for service-level logic.
Deployment:

Packaged the API with Maven.
Deployed it in a cloud-hosted environment for accessibility.
Key Findings
Performance:
MongoDBâ€™s schema-less nature allowed quick development but needed indexing for better search performance.

Scalability:
The microservice architecture of Spring Boot made the API modular and scalable for future enhancements.

Challenges:

Handling dynamic product attributes required careful validation and mapping.
API endpoints had to be optimized to prevent over-fetching of data.
Ease of Use:
Clear API documentation and well-defined responses helped in seamless client integration.

Conclusion
The RESTful API for Product Catalogue successfully met ABC Company's requirements by providing a flexible, fast, and reliable backend solution for product management. The implementation with MongoDB allowed dynamic attributes and easy scalability. Key highlights of the project were:

A user-friendly interface for managing the product catalogue.
Scalability for handling thousands of products.
Seamless integration with client-facing applications.
